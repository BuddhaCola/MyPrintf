# MyPrintf
My version of [printf](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=functions-printf-print-formatted-characters) function for C.\
It look like printf, it acts like printf, can be used as printf.\
Usage: just like C standard library printf, takes one (char *) as first argument, representing a format string, followed by variable amount arguments as corresponded conversion specifications.
>The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output
stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion
specification is introduced by the % character.
