# MyPrintf
**42 project**\
My implementation of standart C library function [printf](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.1?topic=functions-printf-print-formatted-characters).\
It look like printf, it acts like printf and it could be used as printf.
Just like the system function, MyPrintf takes one (char *) as first argument, representing a format string, followed by variable amount arguments as corresponded conversion specifications.
>The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output
stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion
specification is introduced by the % character.
